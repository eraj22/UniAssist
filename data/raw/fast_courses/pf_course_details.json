  "description": "This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of computer programming \n            using C++. Students will learn problem-solving techniques, algorithm development, \n            and structured programming. The course covers basic data types, control structures, \n            functions, arrays, pointers, structures, and file handling. Lab sessions provide \n            hands-on programming experience.",
