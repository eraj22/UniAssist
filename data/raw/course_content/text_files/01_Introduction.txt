================================================================================

C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an enhancement of the C language to add object-oriented paradigm. The main features C++ programming language are as follows:
Simple
: It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, and has a rich library support and a variety of datatypes.
Machine Independent
: C++ code can be run on any machine as long as a suitable compiler is provided.
Low-level Access:
C++ provides low-level access to system resources, which makes it a suitable choice for system programming and writing efficient code.
Fast Execution Speed
: C++ is one of the fastest high-level languages. There is no additional processing overhead in C++, it is blazing fast.
Object-Oriented
: One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. large-scale applications can be built.
First C++ Program
The below C++ code shows the basic structure of a program. Learn more about how it works in this
article
.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
cout
<<
"Hello, World!"
;
return
0
;
}
Output
Hello, World!
Structure of the C++ program
The basic structure of a C++ program defines the standard way every program must be written; otherwise, it will cause a compilation error. The structure includes:
Header File:
#include <iostream> adds input/output objects (cin, cout, etc.) via the preprocessor. Common headers: fstream (files), string (strings), vector (STL), bits/stdc++.h (all-in-one).
Namespace Declaration:
using namespace std; allows direct use of standard names like "cout" without std::
Main Function:
int main() is the program’s entry point; execution starts here and returns an integer with 0 return mean successful execution.
Comments:
// for single line, /*....*/ for multi-line are ignored by the compiler and used only for code documentation.
Statement:
Contains executable code. Here, cout << "Hello World!", prints the text on the screen using the insertion operator (<<).
Return:
The return 0; statement terminates the main() function and indicates that the program executed successfully.
History of C++
C++ is an object-oriented,
middle-level
programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1979, originally called “
C with Classes
” and renamed to C++ in 1983. It extended C by adding features like classes, inheritance, and type checking to support
object-oriented programming
. Over time, it evolved through standards like C++98, C++11, C++17, C++20, and the latest C++23, adding modern features for performance and safety. Today, C++ remains widely used in system software, game engines, competitive programming, and high-performance applications.
