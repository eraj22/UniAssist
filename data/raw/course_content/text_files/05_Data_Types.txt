================================================================================

Data types specify the type of data that a variable can store. Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates memory for that variable based on the data type with which it is declared. Please note that every may require a different amount of memory.
Below is an example of integer data type.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
// Creating a variable to store integer
int
var
=
10
;
cout
<<
var
;
return
0
;
}
Output
10
Explanation
: In the above code, we needed to store the value
10
in our program, so we created a variable
var
. But before
var
, we have used the keyword '
int
'
.
This keyword is used to define that the variable
var
will store data of type
integer
.
Let's see how to use some primitive data types in C++ program.
1. Character Data Type (char)
The
character data type
is used to store a single character. The keyword used to define a character is
char
. Its size is 1 byte, and it stores characters enclosed in single quotes (' '). It can generally store upto 256 characters according to their
ASCII codes.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
// Character variable
char
c
=
'A'
;
cout
<<
c
;
return
0
;
}
Output
A
2. Integer Data Type (int)
Integer data type
denotes that the given variable can store the integer numbers. The keyword used to define integers is
int.
Its size is
4-bytes
(for 64-bit) systems and can store numbers for binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal base systems in the range from
-2,147,483,648
to
2,147,483,647.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
// Creating an integer variable
int
x
=
25
;
cout
<<
x
<<
endl
;
// Using hexadecimal base value
x
=
0x15
;
cout
<<
x
;
return
0
;
}
Output
25
21

Literals in C++
3. Boolean Data Type (bool)
The
boolean data type
is used to store logical values:
true(1)
or
false(0)
. The keyword used to define a boolean variable is
bool
. Its size is 1 byte.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
// Creating a boolean variable
bool
isTrue
=
true
;
cout
<<
isTrue
;
return
0
;
}
Output
1
4. Floating Point Data Type (float)
Floating-point data type
is used to store numbers with decimal points. The keyword used to define floating-point numbers is
float
. Its size is 4 bytes (on 64-bit systems) and can store values in the range from
1.2e-38
to
3.4e+38.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
// Floating point variable with a decimal value
float
f
=
36.5
;
cout
<<
f
;
return
0
;
}
Output
36.5
5. Double Data Type (double)
The
double data type
is used to store decimal numbers with higher precision. The keyword used to define double-precision floating-point numbers is
double
. Its size is 8 bytes (on 64-bit systems) and can store the values in the range from
1.7e-308
to
1.7e+308
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
// double precision floating point variable
double
pi
=
3.1415926535
;
cout
<<
pi
;
return
0
;
}
Output
3.14159
6. Void Data Type (void)
The
void data type
represents the absence of value. We cannot create a variable of void type. It is used for pointer and functions that do not return any value using the keyword
void
.
Type Safety in C++
C++ is a
strongly typed language
. It means that all variables' data type should be specified at the declaration, and it does not change throughout the program. Moreover, we can only assign the values that are of the same type as that of the variable.
If we try to assign
floating point
value to a boolean variable, it may result in data corruption, runtime errors, or undefined behaviour.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
// Assigning float value to isTrue
bool
a
=
10.248f
;
cout
<<
a
;
return
0
;
}
Output
1
As we see, the floating-point value is not stored in the bool variable
a.
It just stores 1. This type checking is not only done for fundamental types, but for all data types to ensure valid operations and no data corruptions.
Data Type Conversion
Type conversion
refers to the process of changing one data type into another compatible one without losing its original meaning. It's an important concept for handling different data types in C++.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
n
=
3
;
char
c
=
'C'
;
// Convert char data type into integer
cout
<<
(
int
)
c
<<
endl
;
int
sum
=
n
+
c
;
cout
<<
sum
;
return
0
;
}
Output
67

Size of Data Types in C++
Earlier, we mentioned that the size of the data types is according to the 64-bit systems. Does it mean that the size of C++ data types is different for different computers?
Actually, it is partially true. The size of C++ data types can vary across different systems, depending on the architecture of the computer (e.g., 32-bit vs. 64-bit systems) and the compiler being used. But if the architecture of the computer is same, then the size across different computers remains same.
We can find the size of the data type using
sizeof
operator. According to this type, the
range of values
that a variable of given data types can store are decided.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
// Printing the size of each data type
cout
<<
"Size of int: "
<<
sizeof
(
int
)
<<
" bytes"
<<
endl
;
cout
<<
"Size of char: "
<<
sizeof
(
char
)
<<
" byte"
<<
endl
;
cout
<<
"Size of float: "
<<
sizeof
(
float
)
<<
" bytes"
<<
endl
;
cout
<<
"Size of double: "
<<
sizeof
(
double
)
<<
" bytes"
;
return
0
;
}
Output
Size of int: 4 bytes
Size of char: 1 byte
Size of float: 4 bytes
Size of double: 8 bytes
Data Type Modifiers
Data type modifiers
are the keywords used to change or give extra meaning to already existing data types. It is added to primitive data types as a prefix to modify their size or range of data they can store. There are 4 type modifiers in C++:
short, long, signed
and
unsigned.
For Example,
defining an
int
with
long
type modifier will change its size to 8 bytes:
C++
int
var1
;
// 4 bytes
long
int
var2
;
// 8 bytes
Similarly, other type modifiers also affect the size or range of the data type.
long double, long long int, unsigned int, etc.
