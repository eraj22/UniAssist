================================================================================

C++ operators are the symbols that operate on values to perform specific mathematical or logical computations on given values. They are the foundation of any programming language.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
a
=
10
+
20
;
cout
<<
a
;
return
0
;
}
Output
30
Explanation: Here, '
+
' is an
addition operator
and does the addition of 10 and 20 operands and return value 30 as a result.
C++ Operator Types
C++ operators are classified into
6 types
on the basis of type of operation they perform:
1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators
are used to perform arithmetic or mathematical operations on the operands. For example, '
+
' is used for addition.
Addition
, +, Adds two operands
Subtraction
, -, Subtracts second operand from the first
Multiplication
, *, Multiplies two operands
Division
, /, Divides first operand by the second operand
Modulo Operation
, %, Returns the remainder of an integer division
Increment
, ++, Increases the value of operand by 1
Decrement
, --, Decreases the value of operand by 1
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
a
=
8
,
b
=
3
;
// Addition
cout
<<
"a + b = "
<<
(
a
+
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Subtraction
cout
<<
"a - b = "
<<
(
a
-
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Multiplication
cout
<<
"a * b = "
<<
(
a
*
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Division
cout
<<
"a / b = "
<<
(
a
/
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Modulo
cout
<<
"a % b = "
<<
(
a
%
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Increament
cout
<<
"++a = "
<<
++
a
<<
endl
;
// Decrement
cout
<<
"b-- = "
<<
b
--
;
return
0
;
}
Output
a + b = 11
a - b = 5
a * b = 24
a / b = 2
a % b = 2
++a = 9
--b = 2
Important Points:
The
Modulo operator
(%) operator should only be used with integers. Other operators can also be used with floating point values.
++a
and
a++
, both are increment operators, however, both are slightly different. In
++a
, the value of the variable is incremented first and then it is used in the program. In
a++
, the value of the variable is assigned first and then it is incremented. Similarly happens for the decrement operator.
You may have noticed that some operator works on two operands while other work on one. On the basis of this operators are also classified as:
Unary
: Works on single operand.
Binary: Works on two operands.
Ternary: Works on three operands.
2. Relational Operators
Relational operators
are used for the comparison of the values of two operands. For example, '>' check right operand is greater.
Is Equal To
, ==, Checks if both operands are equal
Greater Than
, >, Checks if the first operand is greater than the second operand
Greater Than or Equal To
, >=, Checks if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand
Less Than
, <, Checks if the first operand is lesser than the second operand
Less Than or Equal To
, <=, Checks if the first operand is lesser than or equal to the second operand
Not Equal To
, !=, Checks if both operands are not equal
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
a
=
6
,
b
=
4
;
// Equal operator
cout
<<
"a == b is "
<<
(
a
==
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Greater than operator
cout
<<
"a > b is "
<<
(
a
>
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Greater than Equal to operator
cout
<<
"a >= b is "
<<
(
a
>=
b
)
<<
endl
;
//  Lesser than operator
cout
<<
"a < b is "
<<
(
a
<
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Lesser than Equal to operator
cout
<<
"a <= b is "
<<
(
a
<=
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Not equal to operator
cout
<<
"a != b is "
<<
(
a
!=
b
);
return
0
;
}
Output
a == b is 0
a > b is 1
a >= b is 1
a < b is 0
a <= b is 0
a != b is 1
Note: 0 denotes false and 1 denotes true.
3. Logical Operators
Logical operators
are used to combine two or more conditions or constraints or to complement the evaluation of the original condition in consideration. The result returns a Boolean value, i.e., true or false.
Logical AND
, &&, Returns true only if all the operands are true or non-zero
Logical OR
, ||, Returns true if either of the operands is true or non-zero
Logical NOT
, !, Returns true if the operand is false or zero
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
a
=
6
,
b
=
4
;
// Logical AND operator
cout
<<
"a && b is "
<<
(
a
&&
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Logical OR operator
cout
<<
"a || b is "
<<
(
a
||
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Logical NOT operator
cout
<<
"!b is "
<<
(
!
b
);
return
0
;
}
Output
a && b is 1
a || b is 1
!b is 0
4. Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators
are works on bit-level. So, compiler first converted to bit-level and then the calculation is performed on the operands.
Binary AND
, &, Copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands
Binary OR
, |, Copies a bit to the result if it exists in any of the operands
Binary XOR
, ^, Copies the bit to the result if it is present in either of the operands but not both
Left Shift
, <<, Shifts the value to the left by the number of bits specified by the right operand
Right Shift
, >>, Shifts the value to the right by the number of bits specified by the right operand
One's Complement
,
~
, Changes binary digits 1 to 0 and 0 to 1
Note:
Only char and int data types can be used with Bitwise Operators.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
a
=
6
,
b
=
4
;
// Binary AND operator
cout
<<
"a & b is "
<<
(
a
&
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Binary OR operator
cout
<<
"a | b is "
<<
(
a
|
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Binary XOR operator
cout
<<
"a ^ b is "
<<
(
a
^
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Left Shift operator
cout
<<
"a << 1 is "
<<
(
a
<<
1
)
<<
endl
;
// Right Shift operator
cout
<<
"a >> 1 is "
<<
(
a
>>
1
)
<<
endl
;
// One’s Complement operator
cout
<<
"~(a) is "
<<
~
(
a
);
return
0
;
}
Output
a & b is 4
a | b is 6
a ^ b is 2
a<<1 is 12
a>>1 is 3
~(a) is -7
5. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators
are used to assign value to a variable. We assign the value of right operand into left operand according to which assignment operator we use.
Assignment
, =, Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left
Add and Assignment
, +=, Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand
Subtract and Assignment
, -=, Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand
Multiply and Assignment
, *=, Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand
Divide and Assignment
, /=, Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand
C++
#include
<iosteam>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
a
=
6
,
b
=
4
;
// Assignment Operator.
cout
<<
"a = "
<<
a
<<
endl
;
//  Add and Assignment Operator.
cout
<<
"a += b is "
<<
(
a
+=
b
)
<<
endl
;
// Subtract and Assignment Operator.
cout
<<
"a -= b is "
<<
(
a
-=
b
)
<<
endl
;
//  Multiply and Assignment Operator.
cout
<<
"a *= b is "
<<
(
a
*=
b
)
<<
endl
;
//  Divide and Assignment Operator.
cout
<<
"a /= b is "
<<
(
a
/=
b
);
return
0
;
}
Output
a = 6
a += b is 10
a -= b is 6
a *= b is 24
a /= b is 6
6. Ternary or Conditional Operators
Conditional operator
returns the value, based on the condition. This operator takes
three operands
, therefore it is known as a
Ternary Operator
.
Syntax:
C++
Expression1
?
Expression2
:
Expression3
In the above statement:
The ternary operator
?
determines the answer on the basis of the evaluation of
Expression1
.
If
Expression1
is true, then
Expression2
gets evaluated.
If
Expression1
is false, then
Expression3
gets evaluated.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
a
=
3
,
b
=
4
;
// Conditional Operator
int
result
=
(
a
<
b
)
?
b
:
a
;
cout
<<
"The greatest number "
"is "
<<
result
;
return
0
;
}
Output
The greatest number is 4
Miscellaneous Operators
Apart from these operators, there are a few operators that do not fit in any of the above categories. These are:
1. sizeof Operator
sizeof operator
is a unary operator used to compute the size of its operand or variable in bytes. For example,
C++
sizeof
(
char
);
sizeof
(
var_name
);
2. Comma Operator (,)
Comma operator
is a binary operator that is used for multiple purposes. It is used as a separator or used to evaluate its first operand and discards the result; it then evaluates the second operand and returns this value (and type).
C++
int
n
=
(
m
+
1
,
m
-2
,
m
+
5
);
int
a
,
b
,
c
;
3. Addressof Operator (&)
Addressof operator
is used to find the memory address in which a particular variable is stored. In C++, it is also used to create a
reference
.
C++
&
var_name
;
4. Dot Operator(.)
Dot operator
is used to access members of structure variables or class objects using their object names.
C++
obj
.
member
;
5. Arrow Operator
Arrow operator
is used to access the variables of classes or structures through its pointer.
C++
sptr
->
member
;
6. Casting Operators
Casting operators
are used to convert the value of one data type to another data type. For example, for an integer value x:
C++
(
float
)
x
static_cast
<
float
>
(
x
)
Operator Precedency and Associativity
When there are multiple operators in a single expression,
operator precedency and associativity
decide in which order and which part of expression are calculate. Precedency tells which part of expression should be calculate first and associativity tells which direction to solve when same precedency operators are in expression.
Operator Precedence
Operator precedence says which operation is calculate first in the expression when expression have different precedency operators. For example:
3 * 2 + 8;
Will be evaluated as:
(3 * 2) + 8 = 14
It is because
multiplication (*)
have higher precedency then
addition (+).
Operator Associativity
Operator associativity says if expression have more than one operator with same precedence then calculation happen in
right to left
or
left to right.
50 / 25 * 2
= 1
Will be evaluated as:
(50 / 25) * 2
