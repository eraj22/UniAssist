================================================================================

In C++ programming language,
identifiers
are the unique names assigned to variables, functions, classes, structs, or other entities within the program. Let's take a look at an example:
C++
// Creating a variable
int
val
=
10
;
// Creating a function
void
func
()
{}
In the above code, the words
val
and
func
are identifiers. Basically, everything named by a programmer is an identifier and is used to refer to the entity later in the program.
Rules for Naming an Identifier
We can use any word as an identifier as long as it follows the following rules:
An identifier can consist of
letters
(A-Z or a-z),
digits
(0-9), and
underscores (_)
. Special characters and spaces are not allowed.
An identifier can only begin with a
letter or an underscore only.
C++ has reserved
keywords
that cannot be used as identifiers since they have predefined meanings in the language. For example,
int
cannot be used as an identifier as it already has some predefined meaning in C++. Attempting to use these as identifiers will result in a compilation error.
Identifier must be
unique
in its namespace.
Additionally, C++ is a case-sensitive language so the identifier such as
Num
and
num
are treated as different. The below images show some valid and invalid C++ identifiers.
To know more about identifiers naming rules, refer to this article –
Naming Convention in C++
Example of Valid/Invalid Identifiers
Example
In this example, we have used the identifiers by following the guidelines and we use identifiers to name a
class
, function, integer data type, etc. If you are not aware of
functions
and
classes
in C++ then don’t worry, you will learn them soon. The below code is run successfully which means we named them correctly.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
// Here Car identifier is used to refer to below class
class
Car
{
string
Brand
;
string
model
;
int
year
;
};
// getSum identifier is used to call the below
// function
void
getSum
(
int
a
,
int
b
)
{
int
_sum
=
a
+
b
;
cout
<<
"The sum is: "
<<
_sum
;
}
int
main
()
{
// Identifiers used as variable names
int
studentAge
=
20
;
double
accountBalance
=
1000.50
;
string
student_Name
=
"Karan"
;
getSum
(
2
,
10
);
return
0
;
}
Output
The sum is: 12
Identifier Naming Conventions
Naming conventions
are not the rules enforced by C++ language but are suggestions for naming variables by the programming community for easier understanding. Some of the naming conventions are as follows:
For Variables:
Use camelCase (for constants, you can use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)
Start with lowercase alphabet.
Use descriptive, meaningful names.
For example, frequencyCount, personName
For Functions:
Use camelCase.
Use Verb or verb phrases for naming.
For example, getName(), countFrequency(), etc
.
For Classes:
Use PascalCase
Use Nouns or noun phrases for naming.
For example, Car, Person, etc
Once again, above are some suggestions for naming identifiers do not rule. They also depend on the project guidelines you are working on and your preferences.
