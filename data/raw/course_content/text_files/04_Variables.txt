================================================================================

In C++,
variable
is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. The value stored in a variable can be accessed or changed during program execution.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
// Creating a single character variable
int
num
=
3
;
// Accessing and printing above variable
cout
<<
num
<<
endl
;
// Update the value
num
=
7
;
// Printing the updated value
cout
<<
num
;
return
0
;
}
Creating a Variable
Creating a variable and giving it a name is called
variable definition
(sometimes called
variable declaration
). The syntax of variable definition is:
C++
type
name
;
where,
type
is the type of data that a variable can store, and
name
is the name assigned to the variable. Multiple variables of the same type can be defined as:
C++
type
name1
,
name2
,
name3
....;
The
data type
of a variable is selected from the list of data types supported by C++.
To store number without decimal point, we use integer data type.
C++
int
num
;
Here,
int
is the keyword used to tell the compiler that the variable with name
num
will store integer values. The
C++ Course
covers the types of variables in C++ and how to use them effectively in your programs.
Initializing
A variable that is just defined may not contain some valid value.
We have to initialize it to some valid initial value. It is done by using an
assignment operator =
as shown:
C++
int
num
;
num
=
3
;
Definition and initialization can also be done in a single step as shown:
C++
int
num
=
3
;
The integer variable
num
is initialized with the value 3. Values are generally the
literals
of the same type.
Note:
The value we assign should be of the same type as the variable.
Accessing and Updating
The main objective of a variable is to store the data so that it can be retrieved or update any time. Accessing can be done by simply using its assigned name and updating the value using
= assignment operator
.
C++
int
num
=
3
;
// Accessing and printing above variable
cout
<<
num
<<
endl
;
// Update the value
num
=
7
;
cout
<<
num
;
Rules For Naming Variable
The names given to a variable are called
identifiers
. There are some rules for creating these identifiers (names):
A name can only contain
letters
(A-Z or a-z),
digits
(0-9), and
underscores (_)
.
It should start with a
letter or an underscore only.
It is case sensitive.
The name of the variable should not contain any whitespace and special characters (i.e. #, $, %, *, etc).
We cannot use
C++ keyword
(e.g. float, double, class) as a variable name.
How are variables used?
Variables are the names given to the memory location which stores some value. These names can be used in any place where the value it stores can be used.
For example,
we assign values of the same type to variables. But instead of these values, we can also use variables that store these values.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
num1
=
10
,
num2
;
// Assigning num1's value to num2
num2
=
num1
;
cout
<<
num1
<<
" "
<<
num2
;
return
0
;
}
Output
10 10
Addition of two integers can be done in C++ using
+ operator
as shown:
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
cout
<<
10
+
20
;
return
0
;
}
Output
30
We can do the above operation using the variables that store these two values.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
num1
=
10
,
num2
=
20
;
cout
<<
num1
+
num2
;
return
0
;
}
Output
30
Constant Variables
In C++, a
constant variable
is one whose value cannot be changed after it is initialized. This is done using the
const
keyword.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
const
int
num
=
10
;
cout
<<
num
;
return
0
;
}
Output
10
Scope of Variables
Scope of variable
is the region inside the program where the variable can be referred to by using its name. Basically, it is the part of the program where the variable exists. Proper understanding of this concept requires the understanding of other concepts such as functions, blocks, etc.
Memory Management of Variables
When we create or declare a variable, a fixed-size memory block is assigned to the variable, and its initial value is a garbage value. Initialization assigns a meaningful value using the assignment operator. Variables essentially manipulate specific memory locations, and their stored data is accessed via their names.
Moreover, different variables may be stored in different section of memory according to its
storage class
.
