Decision-making is the process to make a decision about which part of the code should be executed or not based on some condition. Decision-making in C++ involves the usage of
conditional statements
(also called decision control statements) to execute specific blocks of code primarily based on given situations and their results.
In C++, the following decision-making statements are available:
1. if Statement
In C++, the
if statement
is the simplest decision-making statement. It allows the execution of a block of code if the given condition is true. The body of the if statement is executed only if the given condition is true.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
age
=
19
;
// Check if age is greater than 18 fo
// vote eligiblity
if
(
age
>
18
)
{
cout
<<
"allowed to vote"
;
}
return
0
;
}
Output
allowed to vote
We can skip to write curly brasses if there is only line statement inside the curly brasses.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
age
=
19
;
if
(
age
>
18
)
cout
<<
"allowed to vote"
;
return
0
;
}
Output
allowed to vote

2. if-else Statement
The
if else
is adecision-making statement allows us to make a decision based on the evaluation of a given condition. If the given condition evaluates to true then the code inside the 'if' block is executed and in case the condition is false, the code inside the 'else' block is executed.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
n
=
5
;
// Using if-else to determine if the number is positive
// or non positive
if
(
n
>
0
)
{
cout
<<
"number is positive."
;
}
else
{
cout
<<
"number is non-positive."
;
}
return
0
;
}
Output
number is positive.

3. if else if Ladder
The
if else if Ladder
statements allow us to include additional situations after the preliminary if condition. The 'else if' condition is checked only if the above condition is not true, and the `else` is the statement that will be executed if none of the above conditions is true. If some condition is true, then not only the associated block is executed.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
age
=
18
;
// if this condition is true child is printed
if
(
age
<
13
)
{
cout
<<
"child"
;
}
// if above above if statement is not true then we check
// this else if condition if it evalutes to true print
// growing age
else
if
(
age
>=
1
and
age
<=
18
)
{
cout
<<
"Growing stage"
;
}
// if none of above condition is true print adult
else
{
cout
<<
"adult"
;
}
return
0
;
}
Output
Growing stage

4. Nested if else
The
nested if else statement
contains an 'if' statement inside another 'if' statement. This structure lets in more complex selection-making by way of comparing multiple conditions. In this type of statement, multiple conditions are checked, and then the body of the last if statement is executed.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
n
=
44
;
// to check if n is positive
if
(
n
>
0
)
{
// to check if the positive n is even or odd
if
(
n
%
2
==
0
)
{
cout
<<
"positive and even number"
;
}
else
{
cout
<<
"positive and odd number"
;
}
}
// to check if the n is 0
else
if
(
n
==
0
)
{
cout
<<
"the number is zero"
;
}
// to check if the n is negative
else
{
cout
<<
"the number is negative"
;
}
return
0
;
}
Output
positive and even number

5. Switch Statement
In C++, the
switch statement
is used when multiple situations need to be evaluated primarily based on the value of a variable or an expression. switch statement acts as an alternative to multiple if statements or if-else ladder and has a cleaner structure and it is easy for handling multiple conditions.
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
char
c
=
'B'
;
switch
(
c
)
{
// if the input character is A then print GFG
case
'A'
:
cout
<<
"GFG"
;
break
;
// if the input character is B then print
// GeeksforGeeks
case
'B'
:
cout
<<
"GeeksforGeeks"
;
break
;
default
:
// if the input character is invalid then print
// invalid input
cout
<<
"invalid input"
;
}
return
0
;
}
Output
GeeksforGeeks

6. Ternary Operator ( ? : )
The
conditional operator
is also known as a
ternary operator
. It is used to write conditional operations provided by C++. The '?' operator first checks the given condition, if the condition is true then the first expression is executed otherwise the second expression is executed. It is an alternative to an if-else condition in C++.
C++
expression
?
statement_1
:
statement_2
;
C++
#include
<iostream>
using
namespace
std
;
int
main
()
{
int
num1
=
10
,
num2
=
40
;
int
max
;
// if the condition is true then num1 will be printed
// else num2 will printed
max
=
(
num1
>
num2
)
?
num1
:
num2
;
cout
<<
max
;
return
0
;
}
Output
40
