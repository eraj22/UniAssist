Suppose\nthe authorities have another text ﬁle containing all the possible initials of every city (such as Islamabad is\nrepresented by IDD and IDH, Lahore by LHY and LHE, etc. in this ﬁle).\nNow Your task is to write code for counting the number of vehicles of each city that passed Golra Mor on a\nparticular day.\nYou are provided 2 text ﬁles: one carrying all the used initials of every city and the other carrying identiﬁed\nnumbers of the day. Sample input ﬁles and output are shown below:\nFile cities.txt content is as follows:\nCity Initial\nIslamabad IDD\nLahore LHY\nIslamabad IDH\nLahore LHE\nFile May16.txt content is as follows, where each line contains number of vehicle:\nLHY 2140\nLHY 2202\nIDD 516\nLHE 888\nYour program should read both the ﬁles and write a new ﬁle named output.txt containing the name of each\ncity and number of vehicles with that city number plate passed on that day. For example, for above given\noutput following should be content of your ﬁle output.txt:\nIslamabad 1\nLahore 3\nYou can make this task fairly easy by using STL\nPage 21 of 32",

(35 Marks)\nPlease read and understand the question carefully before proceeding with design and code writing.\nYou are going to build a minimal Bill Management System (BMS) for a Chemist store like Shaheen Chemists.\nThe developed system will be used for managing the bills of sold items. Each bill will be issued to a customer, a\ncustomer can be either a registered user of the store or can be a non-registered user. The system will be used to sell\nfollowing types of Items: Medicines and Cosmetics. Each sold medicine will have a unique number, name,\nprice, quantity, and description of disease for which it has been prescribed. Similarly, each\nsold cosmetic item will have unique number, name and price.\nChemist store will be selling two types of cosmetics, local and imported. Local cosmetics will be liable to 17%\nGST, that is their price will be calculated by including 17% GST on the listed price. Imported cosmetics will\nhave 17% GST and 4% VAT (value added tax). Furthermore, each imported cosmetic item will have its country\nof origin listed in the bill.\nA registered user will have a unique-id, his email and phone number along with total number of\nbonus points it has accumulated. The chemist store gives special discount to its registered members on each bill.\nThus while buying if the customer provides his valid membership-id then store will give him 1% discount on\nthe total price. Furthermore, a registered user accumulates 100 bonus points if he buys items of price more than\n500. On accumulating 1000 bonus points, a registered user is given further 5% discount on his bill, and his bonus\naccount is reset to zero. If the customer is not registered and wants to have an account with then the system asks\nhim to register himself by providing his name, city, joining date (string).\nYour designed system will be used to manage the bills for sold items and generate total bill after calculating all\nthe sold items in a single bill by incorporating all the taxes and discounts.\nFurthermore, your designed system shall maintain all bills in a list. At any time, system can calculate the total\nsales amount by adding the total amount of each bill. You can use STL-containers to simplify your task.\n(a) (10 Marks) Build a hierarchical diagram of your system by identifying the main classes and the relationships\namong them.\nPage 26 of 32",

(35 Marks)\nPlease read and understand the question carefully before proceeding with design and code writing.\nYou are going to build a minimal Bill Management System (BMS) for a Chemist store like Shaheen Chemists.\nThe developed system will be used for managing the bills of sold items. Each bill will be issued to a customer, a\ncustomer can be either a registered user of the store or can be a non-registered user. The system will be used to sell\nfollowing types of Items: Medicines and Cosmetics. Each sold medicine will have a unique number, name,\nprice, quantity, and description of disease for which it has been prescribed. Similarly, each\nsold cosmetic item will have unique number, name and price.\nChemist store will be selling two types of cosmetics, local and imported. Local cosmetics will be liable to 17%\nGST, that is their price will be calculated by including 17% GST on the listed price. Imported cosmetics will\nhave 17% GST and 4% VAT (value added tax). Furthermore, each imported cosmetic item will have its country\nof origin listed in the bill.\nA registered user will have a unique-id, his email and phone number along with total number of\nbonus points it has accumulated. The chemist store gives special discount to its registered members on each bill.\nThus while buying if the customer provides his valid membership-id then store will give him 1% discount on\nthe total price. Furthermore, a registered user accumulates 100 bonus points if he buys items of price more than\n500. On accumulating 1000 bonus points, a registered user is given further 5% discount on his bill, and his bonus\naccount is reset to zero. If the customer is not registered and wants to have an account with then the system asks\nhim to register himself by providing his name, city, joining date (string).\nYour designed system will be used to manage the bills for sold items and generate total bill after calculating all\nthe sold items in a single bill by incorporating all the taxes and discounts.\nFurthermore, your designed system shall maintain all bills in a list. At any time, system can calculate the total\nsales amount by adding the total amount of each bill. You can use STL-containers to simplify your task.\n(a) (10 Marks) Build a hierarchical diagram of your system by identifying the main classes and the relationships\namong them.\nPage 26 of 32\n\nCS103 - Computer Programming\nSpring 2018\nFinal Exam\n(b) (15 Marks) Write the complete code for all the classes (except main) of your BMS system, including set-\nters/getters (where required), constructor(s) and destructor(s) in addition to the other functions (such as\nprint bill, calculate item price) as discussed above.\nPage 27 of 32\n\nCS103 - Computer Programming\nSpring 2018\nFinal Exam\nPage 28 of 32\n\nCS103 - Computer Programming\nSpring 2018\nFinal Exam\nExtra Sheet\nPage 29 of 32\n\nCS103 - Computer Programming\nSpring 2018\nFinal Exam\n(c) (10 Marks) Given the classes of your system, now create a function name Generate Bill in your main\nclass that calculates the total price from all the items in the bill.

With an s of 3 and the same elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, \narray a is rearranged to store {3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4}. The chunks on this page are underlined for convenience. \nIf a's length is not evenly divisible by s, the remaining elements are untouched. For example, if s is 4 and \narray a stores {5, 4, 9, 2, 1, 7, 8, 6, 2, 10}, a is rearranged to store {2, 9, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 1, 2, 10}. \nIt is also possible that s is larger than a's entire length, in which case the array is not modified at all. You \nmay assume that s is 1 or greater (an s of 1 would not modify the array). If array a is empty, its contents \nshould remain unchanged. \n \nThe following table shows some calls to your method and their expected results:  \n \nArrays and Call \nArray Contents After Call\nint a1[] = {20, 10, 30, 60, 50, 40}; \nreverseChunks(a1,6, 2); \n {10, 20, 60, 30, 40, 50} \nint a2[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16};  \nreverseChunks(a2,8, 3); \n {6, 4, 2, 12, 10, 8, 14, 16} \nInt a3[] = {7, 1, 3, 5, 9, 8, 2, 6, 4, 10, 0, 12}; \nreverseChunks(a3,12, 5); \n {9, 5, 3, 1, 7, 10, 4, 6, 2, 8, 0, 12} \nint a4[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; \nreverseChunks(a4,6, 8); \n {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} \nint a5[]= {}; \nreverseChunks(a5,0, 2); \n{}",

For example, if s is 2 and array a stores \n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, a is rearranged to store {2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5}. With an s of 3 and the same elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, \narray a is rearranged to store {3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4}. The chunks on this page are underlined for convenience. \nIf a's length is not evenly divisible by s, the remaining elements are untouched. For example, if s is 4 and \narray a stores {5, 4, 9, 2, 1, 7, 8, 6, 2, 10}, a is rearranged to store {2, 9, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 1, 2, 10}. \nIt is also possible that s is larger than a's entire length, in which case the array is not modified at all. You \nmay assume that s is 1 or greater (an s of 1 would not modify the array).

The algorithm for bisection method work as follows.  \n \nFirst of all you assume a broad search interval  [low, high] in which your result (in our \ncase square root) falls. Then in each iteration you reduce the size of your search interval \nuntil you find the answer. To reduce the size of your search interval you find the mid \nvalue of the search interval (i.e. mid= (a+b) / 2 ) and check whether your answer lies in \nthe range [low, mid] or [mid, high].

Identify and correct errors, if any.\nYour goal is to write a program for creating a MovieStore.Your MovieStoreshould allow for storage of\nmany movies, where each movies should be represented by its name and a unique ID and ratings it has received\nfrom users (assume there will be only ten ratings per movie). Your MovieStoreshould also store each user\ninformation, where each user can have a name, and unique ID, and the ratings he has given to all movies (assumer\nten ratings from a user). In addition, to basic functionality (you have to identify the basic data members and\nmember functions) your MovieStore should allow facility of performing following operations:\n1\nint main(){\n2\nMovieStore s1, s2; // create two stores\n3\ns1.AddMovie(\"Hobbit\", 4.5); // add a movie with average rating of 4.5\n4\ns1.AddUser(\"Alpha\", 3.7); // add a user with average rating of 3.7\n5\ns1.AddMovieRatings(\"Hobbit\", \"Alpha\") = 5; // Add the user \"Alpha's\"\nrating for movie hobbit\nthis should add the user ratings to movie\n\"Hobbit\" as well as to users record as well\n,→\n,→\n6\ns1.AddMovieRatings(2, 3) = 1; // add the rating of 1 for movie id 2 form\nuser-id 3;\n,→\n7\ncout << s1[\"Hobbit\"]; // should print the movie hobbit ratings\n8\ncout << s1; // should display all the Movie store information\n9\n}\nPage 9 of 13\nContinue...\n\nCS103 - Computer Programming\nSpring 2018\nMid-II\nC\nPage 10 of 13\nContinue...\n\nCS103 - Computer Programming\nSpring 2018\nMid-II\nQuestion III . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

A BinaryStore calculator will\nstore bytes “stored in strings” with their addresses, i.e. at each address in the BinaryStore there is stored a\nByte. Each address will be 4 characters string and each byte will be 8 characters strings. Your goal is to identify\nand write the classes, their data members and functions. Your code must be able to be executed against following\nsample code. Please note that you will have to perform operations at bit-level using characters.\n1\nint main(){\n2\n// address will be only 4 bit long for this problem\n3\n// bytes will be only 8 bit long\n4\n// create a 10 locations binary store for storing addresses and values\n5\nBinaryStore b1(10);\n6\nb1+=\"0011\"; // add a new address to the store\n7\nb1.Add(\"0011\",Byte(\"00000010\")); // add the byte at newly added address\n8\nb1+=\"0110\";\n9\nb1.Add(\"0110\",Byte(\"00000110\"));\n10\nb1+=\"1010\";\n11\nByte nb=b1.Get(\"0011\")+b1.Get(\"0110\"); // add two bytes, bit by bit\n12\nb1.Add(\"1010\",nb);\n13\n14\nByte nb2=b1.Get(\"1010\")+b1.Get(\"0110\");\n15\nbool r=b1.Get(\"0011\")==b1.Get(\"0110\");\n16\ncout<< \"Equal = \" << r << endl;\n17\nb1.Display();\n18\n}\nx Running this code produces following output\nEqual = 0\n0011 00000010\n0110 00000110\n1010 00001000\n(1) (5 Marks) Identify all the operators and functions you need to overload and write.

Your goal is to build a system for managing the package-delivery services. Your TCS company provide\ntwo types of options TwoDayPackage and OvernightPackage. Each package has following associated\ninformation of its sender and recipient, name, address, city, province and postal code. In addition each package\nhas its associated weight(in grams) and cost per gram, this information is used to calculate the shipping cost of\nthe package. Draw a Simley on front page to get three bonus marks.\nIn TwoDayPackage service there is additional ﬂat fee that the shipping company charges for two-day-delivery\nservice. Thus the total shipping cost of TwoDayPackage should be calculated by adding the ﬂat fee to the\nweight-based cost discussed above. In OvernightPackage your company charges an additional fee per gram\nfor overnight-delivery service. Thus in order to calculate shipping cost it adds the additional fee per gram to the\nstandard cost per gram before calculating the shipping cost.\n(a) (3 Marks) Build a hierarchical diagram of your system by identifying the main classes and the relationships\namong them.\nPage 17 of 22",

Your goal is to build a system for managing the package-delivery services. Your TCS company provide\ntwo types of options TwoDayPackage and OvernightPackage. Each package has following associated\ninformation of its sender and recipient, name, address, city, province and postal code. In addition each package\nhas its associated weight(in grams) and cost per gram, this information is used to calculate the shipping cost of\nthe package. Draw a Simley on front page to get three bonus marks.\nIn TwoDayPackage service there is additional ﬂat fee that the shipping company charges for two-day-delivery\nservice. Thus the total shipping cost of TwoDayPackage should be calculated by adding the ﬂat fee to the\nweight-based cost discussed above. In OvernightPackage your company charges an additional fee per gram\nfor overnight-delivery service. Thus in order to calculate shipping cost it adds the additional fee per gram to the\nstandard cost per gram before calculating the shipping cost.\n(a) (3 Marks) Build a hierarchical diagram of your system by identifying the main classes and the relationships\namong them.\nPage 17 of 22\n\nCS103 - Computer Programming\nHobbitesses at Shire\nSample Final Exam\n(b) (9 Marks) Write the complete code for all the classes (except main) of your TCS system.\n(c) (3 Marks) Given the classes of your system, now create a function that displays the address information\nof sender and receiver and calculates the shipping costs for several different Packages.
