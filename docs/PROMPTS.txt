1. Text & LLM Projects
Project Ideas
1. Fine-tune a small LLM on a domain (medical/education/legal) for specialized text
generation.
2. Build a retrieval-augmented chatbot (RAG) using vector search + generative responses
for a specific use case.
3. Prompt-based story generation with controllable plot elements.
4. Multi-document summarization e.g., summarizing multiple research papers or should
be able to summarize the financial documents given in the form of text or images,
should extract correct format from PDF, images or excel sheets etc.
5. Generate coding solutions + automatic test cases from problem statements.
6. Grammar and fluency correction tool using a fine-tuned GPT-like models for Urdu
language.
7. Automatic question generation from textbooks or lecture notes. Verifiable results and
format the question as per needs like MCQ, detailed questions etc. LLM should also be
able to verify the answers.
8. Multi-language translation and summarization using a small generative model.
Theoretical Knowledge Needed
• - NLP basics: tokenization, embeddings, transformer architecture.
• - Sequence modeling: autoregressive and encoder-decoder paradigms.
• - Attention mechanisms and positional encodings.
• - Fine-tuning methods, parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA, adapters).
• - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and dense retrieval (FAISS).
• - Evaluation metrics: BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, perplexity, human eval.i  want you to help me implemen this UNIASSIST PROJECT and make sure all requirements are fullfilled based in the rubric.First quide me on how to implement the entire project on vs code and then we will continue with the research paper .these are the websites from which i need to scrap the data https://bulletin.wustl.edu/search/?search=E81+CSE+240+Logic+and+Discrete+Mathematics ,https://bulletin.wustl.edu/search/?P=E81%20CSE%20247,https://bulletin.wustl.edu/search/?search=CSE+332S,for now  i am scrapping data or making teh entire project based on only 3 courses  atm .i want you to guide me step by step  on how to implement this  ,make checkpoints,for example let in step 1 guide me on how to setup the envireoment and then when i confirm the enviroment has been setup continue next .(i need to make commits as well)

donot use mock data

according to the proposal and project requiremnet what prereqs should we have like a website having notes and info regarding the course ,pastpapers relevant to that course which i will provide manually and Fast university website that will provide details of the course such as credit hours etc

so heres what we have to do now ,keeping the project idea same ,i will give you the link to the website from which i want you to download the data for a specific course ,you will use selenium to scrape it .i will provide you a git hub link which has pastpapers of fast nuces islamabad and then the official website of fast nuces islamabad from which you have to scrape data regardinng courses etc becaus ewe need this information for our project .am i missing smthg else for this part pf the project ?

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/c-plus-plus/ this is the link for pf for c++ website that has notes regarding Programming fundamentals and this is the link https://github.com/nuces-isb-past-papers/fsc-past-papers/tree/main/semester-1/PF that has all pf past papers of the university FAST NUCES islamabd with solutions provided as well and finally this https://isb.nu.edu.pk is the official fast nuces website that only has information regarding what courses the university is offering and the credit outs etc.based on my project proposal  i want to implement a rag system   for The course Programming fundamentals that can answer questions regradinf the pf course and also provide the relevant pastpaper questions to the student etc.i have implemented the setup enviroment now what do i do next ?

i have noticed you have not extracted the relevant pictures which were provided in the geek for geeks website for example to explain some concepts picture can explain those concepts  better .i want that if the student asks a question the rag system can explain to the student throught not only pictures but text as well

so the scrapping part is done ,i have the pastpapers ,notes from the website and course infromation from the uni website ,now what next to do ?i want the student to be able to ask questions regarding the pf  course ,and based on the data the rag system should answer him .i.e the student can upload his own notes ,pastpapers ,pdfs or slides and ask the system to explain the slides or whatever he provides,he can ask thesystem to make a quiz from the pastpapers  and the notes /slides he provides or from the already scrapped data we have ,he can ask the system to list the questions asked in the pastpaper on the topic ,he can submit the quiz and the system can recheck it ,the system can also provides summaries etc.the student can ask course details etc and the system can answer .
